# bbb-jmeter
Jmeter script to load test a BigBlueButton server by stressing the html5-client websocket, this can be useful to test some specific messages and compare performance between changes/versions made to the client to find bottlenecks.

Docker based with grafana and influxdb integration to visualize results:

## What does it do?
- The `test/bbb_23.jmx` script creates a meeting for each line in `test/meetings.csv` and join them with users according to the number of threads defined by `ThreadsOwner` and `ThreadsGuest`.

Then, each user/thread:
- Performs the initial default meteor websocket communication and subscribe to all collections;
- Sends a "Hello" message to chat and change the emojiStatus;
- Enter in a loop to send VoidConnection and a Chat Message for `PingLoopOwner` and `PingLoopGuest` times.

When the Guest/Viewer loop ends, they leave the meeting.  
When the Owner loop ends, they end the meeting.

## Prerequisites
Docker and docker-compose
## Running
- `git clone https://github.com/mconf/bbb-jmeter.git && cd bbb-jmeter`
- Edit `.env` file: 
  - Add the `hostname` and `salt` of the server you want to test against
  - Configure the threads and ping variables as desired
- Edit `test/meetings.csv` if you want to create more than one meeting (and increase `ThreadsOwner` accordingly)
  - format: `meetingName,meetingId,voiceBridge,moderatorUserNamePrefix,guestUserNamePrefix`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`

Open http://localhost:30000/ in your browswer to see live results while test is running, the jmeter logs are stored locally in `$LOG_DIR` folder, and metrics data in the `influx-grafana/influx-data`, so the historical data from previous test are kept and browseable in grafana.
 - default user/password: admin/admin

## Editing test script with Jmeter GUI locally
1. Download latest jmeter https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi (requires Java 8)
1. You will also need the Webscockets Plugin:
   1. Download Jars: https://jmeter-plugins.org/get/ and https://jmeter-plugins.org/files/packages/websocket-samplers-1.2.8.zip (need to extract)
   1. Copy the jars to the `lib/ext` folder inside jmeter
1. Open `jmeter.sh`|`jmeter.bat`

While editing, to make small tests and debug, disable `Backend Listener` and enable `View Results Tree/Table` to see the exact errors.
